## Outline

I. Introduction
    - PREFACE 
    - Can't talk about issues in music and science without racism in music and science
    - Might think MS is too niche, but here to tell you otherwise 
    - Going to talk about a lot of things that make people uncomfortable
    - Going to do my best to preserve the space, but will ask people to leave
    - That said, are things in this lecture that people will find upsetting
II. Racism 
    - Before talking about racism, need to be on same page of what we mean
    - NOT like science in that it is thing to be discovered or not 
    - NOT all claims are scientific claims, under POPPER LITE these are metaphysical
    - Metaphysical because XYZ
    - For purposes of this lesson use Ibrahm 
    - RACISM: 
    - ANTIRACISM: 
III. Racism and Science in Society 
    - Remember, this is not just an intellectual thought experiment 
    - Issues discussed here are faced by many daily 
    - If you have not experienced, this that is OK 
    - These are deep issues and are hard to work through
    - As result, sometimes people get uncomfortable 
    - Point is we happen to live in unjust society 
    - Many recent examples of mistreatment of blacks
    - NON SCIENTIFIC 
    - For example: opening of saini 
    - For example: slavery
    - For Example: Mismeasure of Man  
    - In each, have power of society imposing belief structure 
    - SCIENCE has lots of power in society 
    - Actions from SCIENTIFIC Community impact society 
    - SCIENTIFIC 
    - Examples: Superior
    - Examples: Mismeasure of Man 
IV. Racism in Music and Science  
    - Going to now show examples of this within music
    - (knowing science makes its way in and out) 
    - Sometimes issues are right infront of us, but hard to put finger on
    - going to try to show you one of many patterns this occurs
    - Start with historical example: Fetis 
    - FETIS 
    - FETIS Quote
    - Does it fit definition of racism?
    - Why? 
V. Induction Deduction Review  
    - Science begins with induction
    - INDUCTION Definition
    - DEDUCTION Definition 
    - DEMARCATION Definition
    - METAPHYSICAL Definition
    - SCIENTIFIC Definition 
    - Use our senses to better understand the outside world 
    - As learned, problem is that our value systems shape our perception
    - Classic example is geocentric universe 
    - Back in day, had idea that this planet was all there was
    - Stems from philosophical beliefs about the world 
    - Even with development of teloscope, new data did not lead to immediate change
    - Great discussion of this with Feyerabend   
    - Leads to naive realism: belif that senses approximate a real world 
    - Also leads to problems of circularity 
    - INDUCTION: Revisited 
    - Swan Problem
    - Have created INDUCTIVE claim that all swans are white
    - This is based on what your senses (eyes) have told you
    - You form a mental category in your head of what it looks like to be a swam
    - Your THEORY is that all swans are white
    - As learned before, eventually you run into a BLACK swan 
    - Assuming there is some TRUTH about what it means to be a swan, your theory is bad
    - So what do we TYPICALLY do in this example? 
    - We go back to the swan theory drawing board and revise what our category is
    - In guest and martin framework, we climb back up the path model 
    - BUT this isn't the only option 
    - COULD double down on your claim and say that to be a swan you must be white
    - This is a sneaky, and dishonest move 
    - Why? 
    - Says that this is what we meant all along, but technically not right
    - But if we p-hack our theory, (Durhim quine?) what was our falsifiable theory is now updated 
    - We said this is what we meant all along and are now able to say that black swans are not real swans. 
    - We claim to be studying SWANS as a broad category
    - Really we have let a value system inflitrate our SCIENTIFIC inquirty that only permits whiteness in swans
    - Instead of exapand the category of swan and think about definition (Guest and Martin) 
    - Instead double down to uphold our value system 
    - We have p hacked our theory to make it work when we want it and are sore loosers 
    - Can this happen in music? 
    - We can call this shell game swap? 
VI. Music Examples: Rap
    - Let's look at how this might happen in music with few examples
    - RAP MUSIC
    - Imagine you are defining music (a metaphysical claim!) 
    - NOTE: This is metaphysical claim 
    - You say that in order to be music you need it to involve people, make sounds, and be white  
    - Clearly this comes from your own perceptual experience 
    - This goes all good and well until you find new music 
    - New music involves people, makes sounds, and is black 
    - BLACK music doesnt fit your perscribed category of music
    - Two choices
    - REVISE Category of what you call music (metaphysical claim), admit theoretical defeat for bad question
    - DOUBLE DOWN and narrow your category
    - Of course, we see this happen in society all the time
    - EXAMPLES OF RAP NOT MUSIC 
    - NOTE: Going to show examples here, but even this positioning makes it seem like legitimte question
    - NOTE: THIS IS NOT A LEGITIMATE QUESTION BECAUSE IT IS NOT SCIENTIFIC 
    - EXAMPLE A
    - EXAMPLE B
    - EXAMPLE C
    - What is wrong with this approach?
    - Uses power of institution to oppress, exclude and marginalize others
    - Reasoning is totally circular
    - cherry pick results
    - ignoring all of other assumptions 
    - focusing on this ignores everything else 
    - really question of values  
    - IMPOSES values system on system that does not share it
    - kofi agawu 
    - adam neely 
VII. Music Examples: Schenker 
    - HAVE set of musical features we are focuse don 
    - FOR EXAMPLE really like harmony in western art music 
    - Pick these values as the metrics we do  
    - Create this metric for the MASTERWORKS 
    - Thus everythig else is out of the category 
    - saltxer: tries but people laugh at him
    - blues: but misses the point
    - PROBLEM I: This misses out on the key featuers of the music 
    - PROBLEM II: Teleological fallacy
    - music is evolving (wrong use of evolutoin)
    - See this with SCHENKER (quote)
    - See this with Schoernberg (quote) 
    - See this with contemporary (quote) 
    - ANSWER: These are not scientific questions... 
VIII. Music Examples: Psychometrics  
    - Carl Seashore: Attempt to measure and define musicality 
    - Pick battery of tests suited to value system (psychoacoustics) 
    - Validate with value system 
    - joanna devay 
    - Use it in strange situations: marijuanan
    - ABUSE it in non-valid construct: GB Johnson
    - GB Johnson Quotes 
    - Also other Factors at Play
XI. Music Examples: Science Paper 
    - Induction: value system of what is music 
    - Methods say XYZ 
    - Use system to appraise other cultures
    - Double down on post hoc, literally write in paper that you changed your criteria 
    - Pass off inductive claim as you make it as deductive claim 
X. One Recipie
    - Inductively Create Tool
    - Pick features that exemplificy values 
    - Use tool from position of power on other cultures
    - Assert inferiority 
XI. Other Problems
    - This inductive loop is NOT the only problem
    - Also see this with ideas from MEYER
    - ATOMISM 
    - REDUCTIONSIM
    - UNIVERSALISM 
XII. Future Reading
    - Saini
    - Ewell
    - Gould
    - Neely 
    - Pillonen
