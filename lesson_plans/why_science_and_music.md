# Why Science and Music? 

This repository contains all the information for the IMS lecture Why Sciene and Music?
This is the first lecture of the course and attempts to set the tone for the class.
A fair amount of time should be devoted to introducing students to the online learning environment. 

In the first lecture I also make it a goal to show students that course is what you put into it.
Fully expect with everything happening in the world now, taking courses online is stressful.

## Learning Objectives 

This lecture focuses on introducing students to the question of why pair music and science.
The first lecture sets the scope and tone of the course.
In scope, we will not do everything justice because we are taking two massive topics introducing them.
In tone, we equally value humanistic and scientific inquiry and assume that the collision of them yields the insight. 

By the end of this lesson students will be able to:
