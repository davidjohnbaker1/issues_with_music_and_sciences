Language (The Damasio 1996 paper is a classic, the next two are both my own work and both include music)

Memory

I think this paper is great for teaching double-dissociations: Bechara, A., Tranel, D., Damasio, H., Adolphs, R., Rockland, C., & Damasio, A. (1995). Double dissociation of conditioning and declarative knowledge relative to the amygdala and hippocampus in humans. Science, 269, 1115-1118. 



For music-specific stuff

There really isn't enough lesion work in music cognition, IMO. A few papers from Peretz and others looked at emotion recognition in patients with amygdala damage:

Gosselin, N., Peretz, I., Johnsen, E., & Adolphs, R. (2007). Amygdala damage impairs emotion recognition from music. Neuropsychologia, 45, 236–244.

Gosselin, N., Samson, S., Adolphs, R., Noulhiane, M., Roy, M., Hasboun, D., … Peretz, I. (2006). Emotional responses to unpleasant music correlates with damage to the parahippocampal cortex. Brain, 129, 2585–2592.

Johnsen, E. L., Tranel, D., Lutgendorf, S., & Adolphs, R. (2009). A neuroanatomical dissociation for emotion induced by music. International Journal of Psychophysiology, 72, 24–33. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2008.03.011



Most of the lesion-based stuff relating to music is about acquired amusia. Peretz has a bunch of older papers that I can't seem to find right now, but this is a good recent one:

Sihvonen, A. J., Ripolles, P., Leo, V., Rodriguez-Fornells, A., Soinila, S., & Sarkamo, T. (2016). Neural basis of acquired amusia and its recovery after stroke. Journal of Neuroscience, 36(34), 8872–8881. 



There are also some lesion papers on musical anhedonia. Psyche and I cite all of them in our review: Belfi, A. M., & Loui, P. (2020).
